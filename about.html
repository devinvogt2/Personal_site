            <p>When I was in the fourth grade I started playing 
                football, and became entranced by the game.
                I played until my senior year of highschool, mostly playing on the defensive side of the ball.
                My Mom and I are huge Oklahoma Sooners fans! I've been watching OU football ever since I can remember. 
                I'd have to say watching them has to be my favorite hobby.

            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>I've been playing video games ever since I was just a little kid. One of the first ever video games I played was called 
                Star Wars Galaxies, It's a very old online MMO that came out in 2003 I believe. Now I'm twenty-three and still hooked on video games.
                Right now I mainly just play UFC 4, but I'm really excited for this new upcoming game called Hogwarts Legacy. It looks super cool! I can't get too hooked on them though,
                always practicing my ABC haha.

            <img id="cookingPhoto" src="cook.jpeg">
            <p>I love to cook, unfortunately I dont love it as a job (I grill at Texas Roadhouse). I first found my intrest in cooking from my Mom
                I'd always ask to help her cook when I was younger because it looked so fun! My mom still even comes over to my house for thanksgiving
            and we'll cook a whole feast together!
